This is a feature-rich, memory-efficient, and type-safe library to
manipulate Zip archives in Haskell. The library is the most complete and
efficient implementation of .ZIP specification in pure Haskell (at least
from open-sourced ones). In particular, it's created with large multimedia
data in mind and provides all features users might expect, comparable in
terms of feature-set with libraries like `libzip` in C.

## Why this library is written

There are a few libraries to work with Zip archives, yet every one of them
provides only a subset of all the functionality a user may need (obviously
the libraries provide functionality that their authors needed) and otherwise
is flawed in some way so it cannot be easily used in some situations. Let's
examine all the libraries available on Hackage to understand motivation for
this package.

### zip-archive

`zip-archive` is a widely used library. It's quite old, well-known and
simple to use. However it creates Zip archives purely, as `ByteStrings`s in
memory that you can then write to the file system. This is not acceptable if
you work with more-or-less big data. For example, if you have collection of
files with total size of 500 MB and you want to pack them into an archive,
you can easily consume up to 1 GB of memory (the files plus resulting
archive). Not always you can afford to do this or do this at scale. Even if
you want just to look at list of archive entries it will read it into memory
in all its entirety. For my use-case it's not acceptable.

### LibZip

This is a binding to C
library [`libzip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libzip). There is always a
certain kind of trouble when you are using bindings. For example, you need
to take care that target library is installed and its version is compatible
with the version of your binding. Yes, this means additional headaches. It
should be just “plug and play”, but now you need to watch out for
compatibility.

It's not that bad with libraries that do not break their API for years, but
it's not the case with `libzip`. As the maintainer of `LibZip` puts it:

> libzip 0.10, 0.11, and 1.0 are not binary compatible. If your C library is
> 0.11.x, then you should use LibZip 0.11. If your C library is 1.0, then
> you should use LibZip master branch (not yet released to Hackage).

Now, on my machine I have version 1.0. To put the package on Stackage we had
to use version 0.10, because Stackage uses Ubuntu to build packages and
libraries on Ubuntu are always ancient. This means that I cannot use the
version of the library from Stackage, and I don't yet know what will be on
the server.

After much frustration with all these things I decided to avoid using of
`LibZip`, because after all, this is not that sort of a project that
shouldn't be done in pure Haskell. By rewriting this in Haskell, I also can
make it safer to use.

### zip-conduit

This one uses the right approach: leverage a good streaming library
(`conduit`) for memory-efficient processing. This is however is not
feature-rich and has certain problems (including programming style, it uses
`error` if an entry is missing in archive, among other things), some of them
are reported on its issue tracker. It also does not appear to be maintained
(the last sign of activity was on December 23, 2014).

## Features

The library supports all features specified in the modern .ZIP specification
except for encryption and multi-disk archives. See more about this below.

For reference, here is a [copy of the specification](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/APPNOTE/APPNOTE-6.3.3.TXT).

### Compression methods

`zip` supports the following compression methods:

* Store (no compression, just store files “as is”)
* [DEFLATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE)
* [Bzip2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2)

The best way to add a new compression method to the library is to write a
conduit that will do the compression and publish it as a library. `zip` can
then depend on it and add it to the list of supported compression methods.
The current list of compression methods reflects what is available on
Hackage at the moment.

### Encryption

Encryption is currently not supported. Encryption system described in the
.ZIP specification is known to be seriously flawed, so it's probably not the
best way to protect your data anyway. The encryption method seems to be a
proprietary technology of PKWARE (at least that's what stated about it in
the .ZIP specification), so to hell with it.

### Sources of file data

The library gives you many options how to get file contents to compress and
how to get extracted data. The following methods are supported:

* *File name.* This is an efficient method to perform compression or
  decompression. You just specify where to get data or where to save it and
  the rest is handled by the library.
* *Conduit source or sink.*
* *ByteString.* Use it only with small data.
* *Copy file from another archive.* An efficient operation, file is copied
  “as is”—no re-compression is performed.

### ZIP64

When necessary, the `ZIP64` extension is automatically used. It's necessary
when anything from this list takes place:

* Total size of archive is greater than 4 GB.
* Size of compressed/uncompressed file in archive is greater than 4 GB.
* There are more than 65535 entries in archive.

The library is particularly suited for processing of large files. For
example, I've been able to easily create 6.5 GB archive with reasonable
speed and without significant memory consumption.

### Filenames

The library has API that makes it impossible to create archive with
non-portable or invalid file names in it.

As of .ZIP specification 6.3.2, files with Unicode symbols in their names
can be put into Zip archives. The library supports mechanisms for this and
uses them automatically when needed. Besides UTF-8, CP437 is also supported
as it's required in the specification.

### Meta-information about files

The library allows to attach comments to entire archive or individual files,
and also gives its user full control over extra fields that are written to
file headers, so the user can store arbitrary information about file in the
archive.

## Quick start

The module `Codec.Archive.Zip` provides everything you may need to
manipulate Zip archives. There are three things that should be clarified
right away, to avoid confusion in the future.

First, we use the `EntrySelector` type that can be obtained from relative
`FilePath`s (paths to directories are not allowed). This method may seem
awkward at first, but it will protect you from the problems with portability
when your archive is unpacked on a different platform.

The second thing, that is rather a consequence of the first, is that there
is no way to add directories, or to be precise, *empty directories* to your
archive. This approach is used in Git, and I find it quite sane.

Finally, the third feature of the library is that it does not modify archive
instantly, because doing so on every manipulation would often be
inefficient. Instead we maintain a collection of pending actions that can be
turned into an optimized procedure that efficiently modifies archive in one
pass. Normally this should be of no concern to you, because all actions are
performed automatically when you leave the realm of `ZipArchive` monad. If,
however, you ever need to force an update, the `commit` function is your
friend. There are even “undo” functions, by the way.

Let's take a look at some examples that show how to accomplish most typical
tasks with help of the library.

To get full information about archive entries, use `getEntries`:

```haskell
λ> withArchive archivePath (M.keys <$> getEntries)
```

This will return a list of all entries in the archive at `archivePath`. It's
possible to extract contents of an entry as a strict `ByteString`:

```haskell
λ> withArchive archivePath (getEntry entrySelector)
```

…to stream them to a given sink:

```haskell
λ> withArchive archivePath (sourceEntry entrySelector mySink)
```

…to save a specific entry to a file:

```haskell
λ> withArchive archivePath (saveEntry entrySelector pathToFile)
```

…and finally just unpack the entire archive into some directory:

```haskell
λ> withArchive archivePath (unpackInto destDir)
```

See also `getArchiveComment` and `getArchiveDescription`.

Modifying is also easy, efficient, and powerful. When you want to create a
new archive use `createArchive`, otherwise `withArchive` will do. To add an
entry from `ByteString`:

```haskell
λ> createArchive archivePath (addEntry Store "Hello, World!" entrySelector)
```

You can stream from `Source` as well:

```haskell
λ> createArchive archivePath (sinkEntry Deflate source entrySelector)
```

To add contents from a file, use `loadEntry`:

```haskell
λ> let toSelector = const (mkEntrySelector "my-entry.txt")
λ> createArchive archivePath (loadEntry BZip2 toSelector myFilePath)
```

Finally, you can copy an entry from another archive without re-compression
(unless you use `recompress`, see below):

```haskell
λ> createArchive archivePath (copyEntry srcArchivePath selector selector)
```

It's often desirable to just pack a directory:

```haskell
λ> createArchive archivePath (packDirRecur Deflate mkEntrySelector dir)
```

It's also possible to:

* rename an entry with `renameEntry`
* delete an entry with `deleteEntry`
* change compression method with `recompress`
* change comment associated with an entry with `setEntryComment`
* delete comment with `deleteEntryComment`
* set modification time with `setModTime`
* manipulate extra fields with `addExtraField` and `deleteExtraField`
* check if entry is intact with `checkEntry`
* undo changes with `undoEntryCanges`, `undoArchiveChanges`, and `undoAll`
* force changes to be written to file system with `commit`

This should cover all your needs. Feel free to open an issue if you're
missing something.
